Linux System Information
=========================

This is a light-weight library to gather information (stats) about the Linux system it is running on.

The information is read from the files in /proc/* and /etc/*. These are usually world readable, but your system may vary. There is no dependency on `system` or `exec`calls to binaries installed on your system.
